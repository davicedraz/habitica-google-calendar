# Habitica Google Apps Script - Calendar Integration 

This script aims to take advantage of all the abstraction contained within the use of the [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) platform, that makes easier to create and publish add-ons in an online store for Google Calendar, Docs, Slides, and Forms, to turn my calendar events into tasks in my favorite gamefied task tracking app: Habitica.

## About

[Habitica](https://habitica.com) is an open source habit building program which treats your life like a Role Playing Game. Level up as you succeed, lose HP as you fail, earn money to buy weapons and armor.

Thanks to Habitica's public API, it is possible to:

- Transform each new event on a calendar of your choice, into a Habitica `task`, so you will earn gold and EXP when you complete it
- Whenever a new event is created, Google's own trigger is responsible for triggering a POST request for Habitica's API and creating your `task` with the information you want, and even with an image!
- Still in the Google Script panel, you can define a verification routine so that your daily Habitica tasks also keep up with your schedule changes

## Usage
```
Just copy, paste & run!
```

If you don't know Google App Scripts and have no idea how to use the script above, check the video below to know more, then copy all of the code from the `index.gs` file,click [here](https://script.google.com/home), press `New Project`, paste the code, add your User ID and your API token from here (https://habitica.com/user/settings/api), and place it in their designated variables.

Example:

    `const HABITICA_TOKEN = "INSERT API TOKEN HERE";` (keep the key surrounded by quotations)
    
    `const HABITICA_ID = "INSERT USER ID HERE";` (keep the key surrounded by quotations)
