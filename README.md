# Habitica Google Apps Script - Calendar Integration 

This script aims to take advantage of all the abstraction contained within the use of the [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) platform, that makes easier to create and publish add-ons in an online store for Google Calendar, Docs, Slides, and Forms, to turn my calendar events into tasks in my favorite gamefied task tracking app: Habitica.

## About

[Habitica](https://habitica.com) is an open source habit building program which treats your life like a Role Playing Game. Level up as you succeed, lose HP as you fail, earn money to buy weapons and armor.

Thanks to Habitica's public API, it is possible to:

- Transform each new event on a calendar of your choice, into a Habitica `task`, so you will earn gold and EXP when you complete it
- Whenever a new event is created, Google's own trigger is responsible for triggering a POST request for Habitica's API and creating your `task` with the information you want, and even with an image!
- Still in the Google Script panel, you can define a verification routine so that your daily Habitica tasks also keep up with your schedule changes

## Usage
```
Just copy, paste & run!
```
